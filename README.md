Meshes
======
This repository contains Python/[Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) code to create boundary meshes for use with [Bempp](http://bempp.com).

These meshes can be made using the following Python code.

```python
import meshes
cake = meshes.Cake(h=0.1)
```

The Gmsh geo string for this mesh can be generated by calling:

```python
cake.to_geo_string()
```

A Bempp grid can be generated by calling:

```python
cake.to_bempp_grid()
```

This will raise an `ImportError` if Bempp is not installed.
