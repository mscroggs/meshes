Meshes
======
This repository contains Python/[Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) code to create boundary meshes for use with [Bempp](http://bempp.com).

These meshes can be made using the following Python code.

```python
import meshes
cake = meshes.Cake(h=0.1)
```
The parameter `h` sets the mesh size.

The Gmsh geo string for this mesh can be generated by calling:

```python
cake.to_geo_string()
```

A Bempp grid can be generated by calling:

```python
cake.to_bempp_grid()
```
This will raise an `ImportError` if Bempp is not installed.

Meshes

The following meshes are included here.

* Birthday Cake (`meshes.Cake`)

   This is a mesh of a birthday cake with one candle, as used in Figure 18 of [Scroggs *et al* (2017)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122117304789).

   `meshes.Cake` takes one parameter: the grid size `h`.

* Christmas Tree (`meshes.ChristmasTree`)

   This is a mesh of a Christmas tree.

   `meshes.ChristmasTree` takes one parameter: the grid size `h`.
